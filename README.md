## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github profile! I'm currently pursueing a career in academics, but I also like doing projects related to the application of machine learning in my spare time.
I've created this profile as a way to demonstrate my portfolio, and as a reminder to keep improving. 

I wonder how you found the page? Reach out and tell me about it.
